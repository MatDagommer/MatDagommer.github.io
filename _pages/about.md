Data Science Co-op @Moderna. 


I am passionate about computational and data-driven solutions in the biomedical space.


I combine my enthusiasm for machine learning with my interests in biomedical science, biomedical imaging, signal processing and drug discovery.


My background in applied physics gave me a strong appetence for uncertainty quantification, which makes me a big fan of Bayesian methods today.


I am currently learning to use graph neural networks in cheminformatics to perform molecular property prediction and molecule generation.
